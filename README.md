Ludum Dare 41 Theme was **"Combine 2 Incompatible Genres"**

## FLAPPY SOCCER

Combining the challenge of the Flappy genre, and the joy of scoring goals in soccer, Flappy Soccer offers quite big difficulty and fun experience. You need to score a goal to be able to pass through the gap, and of course catch the ball again, because you're gonna need it for the next gap!
